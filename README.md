# Assignment 17.1: Comparing Classifiers

## Overview
This project analyzes a bank marketing dataset to predict customer subscription to term deposits. We apply and compare classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM—along with hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation.

## Summary of Findings
- The baseline model achieved ~88.7% accuracy.
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM were tested.
- GridSearchCV improved Decision Tree F1-score significantly.
- Best-performing model: Decision Tree after tuning.
- F1-score was chosen due to class imbalance.
